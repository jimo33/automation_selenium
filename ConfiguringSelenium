These are steps to install Intelli J, Python, and Selenium on your system


Installing Intelli 
Go to 

In the terminal window

Certainly! To set up the development environment for mobile automation testing using Selenium with Python in IntelliJ IDEA, 
you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Install Python: Download and install Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
according to your operating system. Make sure to select the option to add Python to the system PATH during installation.

2. Install IntelliJ IDEA: Download and install the community edition of IntelliJ IDEA from the JetBrains website 
(https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

3. Create a New Project: Launch IntelliJ IDEA and click on "Create New Project" or select "New" -> "Project" from the main menu. 
Choose "Pure Python" as the project type and provide a name and location for your project. Click "Create."

4. Configure Python Interpreter: Once the project is created, you need to configure the Python interpreter. 
Go to "File" -> "Settings" -> "Project" -> "Python Interpreter." Click on the gear icon and select "Add." 
Choose the Python interpreter you installed in step 1 and click "OK."

5. Install Required Packages: Open the Terminal window in IntelliJ IDEA and execute the following command to 
install the required packages:

From the terminal window in Intelli J
```bash
pip install selenium
```

1. Create a Python File: Right-click on your project in the Project Explorer and select "New" -> "Python File." 
Provide a name for the file and click "OK."

2: Write Test Code: In the newly created Python file, you can write your mobile automation test code using Selenium. 
Here's a simple example that launches the Chrome browser and opens a URL:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
# Set the path to the chromedriver executable
driver_path = "/path/to/chromedriver"
# Create a new instance of the Chrome driver
driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=driver_path)
# Open a URL
driver.get("https://www.example.com")
# Perform actions or assertions on the webpage
# Quit the browser
driver.quit()
```

Make sure to replace `"/path/to/chromedriver"` with the actual path to the chromedriver executable on your system. 
You can download the chromedriver from the official Chromium website (https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/).
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1. Run the Test: Right-click within the Python file and select "Run" to execute the test.

That's it! You have set up the development environment using IntelliJ IDEA with Python and created a basic Selenium test script. 
You can expand upon this example and explore the Selenium documentation for more advanced usage and features.

Note: If you prefer using a different web browser, you can download the corresponding driver 
(e.g., geckodriver for Firefox) and adjust the code accordingly.
